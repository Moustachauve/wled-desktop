    For legitimate safety reasons, modern browsers don't allow websites from an
    encrypted request to make unencrypted requests. WLED devices are limited to
    unencrypted requests.

  <p>You can do one of the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Open this page in
      <a href="#" (click)="openUnencryptedPage()">Unencrypted mode</a> (HTTP)
    </li>
    <li>Download the Desktop app (Coming soon!).</li>
    <li>Access the devices directly by address.</li>
  </ol>

<mat-dialog-actions>
  <button mat-button (click)="openUnencryptedPage()">
    Open Unencrypted Page (HTTP)
